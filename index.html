        <p><em><a href="https://ruchitada.com/ui-ux-design/">UI UX Designer and Developer</a></em></p>
        <p>My name is Ruchi Tada. I am a UI UX Designer. I completed my Masters in Luxury and Fashion Management from the Savannah College of Art and Design (SCAD) in March 2020 and learning to become a Fullstack Developer.

          I enjoy the process of designing and making new things which provide value to the users. I am trying to merge my background of fashion design, digital marketing and business strategy to help brands tell their story by seamlessly connecting the
          technology with enhanced user experience.
